# Parkinsons-Families-Project

The Parkinson’s Families Project is a UK-wide study aimed at identifying genetic variation associated with familial and early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). We recruited individuals with a clinical diagnosis of PD and age at motor symptom onset ≤ 45 years and/or a family history of PD in up to third-degree relatives. We analysed DNA samples with a combination of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array genotyping, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We investigated the association between identified pathogenic mutations and demographic and clinical factors such as age at motor symptom onset, family history, motor symptoms (MDS-UPDRS) and cognitive performance (MoCA). Here we present the script used to perform all statistical analysis in Tables 1 and 2, Supplementary Tables 7, 8 and 10, and all panels in Supplementary Figure 2.
